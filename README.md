# Monoair for Ghost

*This is a monospace variant of the Air theme for Ghost.*

Air is a simple and minimal theme for the Ghost blogging platform, in use at mrnordstrom.com. It aims to provide a clean and readable theme with as little code as possible.

It can be used as a starter theme if you prefer the minimalist approach and adding your own tools, rather than larger starter themes that come with preprocessing, Grunt tasks, CSS normalization, and so on out of the box.

**Note:** Some variants of Fira Sans are left out—such as bold italic—and only the WOFF format is embedded. All weights and variants are available in the [WOFF kit](https://github.com/dnordstrom/kit.firasans), and other formats on Mozilla’s website. For compatibility with outdated browsers, consider using, for example, Open Sans from Google Web Fonts.
